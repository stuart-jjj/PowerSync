"""
Built-in LP Battery Optimizer for PowerSync.

Replaces external HAEO dependency with a direct scipy-based Linear Programming
optimizer. Falls back to a greedy heuristic if scipy is unavailable.

Action model:
- CHARGE: Force grid → battery (LP detects grid_import > load)
- EXPORT: Force battery → grid for profit (LP detects grid_export > 0 AND battery_discharge > 0)
- IDLE: Hold battery at current SOC (set backup reserve = current SOC to prevent discharge)
- SELF_CONSUMPTION: Everything else — battery operates naturally (solar charging, home loads)

We only FORCE the battery when it needs to do something it wouldn't do naturally.
Grid charging and grid exporting require force commands. Everything else is natural
self-consumption behavior.
